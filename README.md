# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

This repository contains an analysis of a dataset from CryptoCompare that uses unsupervised machine learning techniques to classify cryptocurrencies. This includes:

- Pre-processing the data
- Applying the Principal Component Analysis algorithm to reduce the dimensions to three principal components
- Creating an elbow curve to apply the K-means algorithm, clustering the data into four classes
- Visualizing the classes using 2d and 3d scatterplots, as seen below
